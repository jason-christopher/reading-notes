# Django

## Intro to Django

### Object-Relational Mapper

* Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.

### URLs and Views

* A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.
* To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

### Templates

* Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

### Forms

* Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

### Authentication

* Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

### Admin

* One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.

### Security

* Django provides multiple protections against:
  * Clickjacking
  * Cross-site scripting
  * Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  * SQL injection
  * Remote code execution

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

* Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.
* So where does this Django behind the scenes tour leave us? Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.

## Things I want to know more about

* I feel like these readings were really bad about how to use Django. So I'd be curious how to actually implement Django ina  project.
