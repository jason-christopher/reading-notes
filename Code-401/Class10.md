# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common terminology for a stack is

1. *Push* - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2. *Pop* - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
3. *Top* - This is the top of the stack.
4. *Peek* - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
5. *IsEmpty* - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### FILO

***First In Last Out*** - This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

### LIFO

***Last In First Out*** - This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Stack Visualization

The topmost item is denoted as the `top`. When you push something to the stack, it becomes the new `top`. When you pop something from the stack, you pop the current `top` and set the next `top` as `top.next`.

### Push O(1)

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an `O(1)` operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (`n`) you have in the stack.

When adding a Node, you `push` it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its `next` property equal to the original `top`.

```
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```

### Pop O(1)

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a `pop`, the `top` Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the `top` Node is returned to the user.

Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `pop`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

```
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

### Peek O(1)

When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `top` Node of the stack.

Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

We do not re-assign the `next` property when we `peek` because we want to keep the reference to the next Node in the stack. This will allow the `top` to stay the top until we decide to `pop`.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

### IsEmpty O(1)

Here is the pseudocode for `isEmpty`:

```

ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

## What is a Queue

Common terminology for a queue is

1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### FIFO

***First In First Out*** - This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

### LILO

***Last In Last Out*** - This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

### Queue Visualization

Here is what a `Queue` looks like:

### Enqueue O(1)

When you add an item to a queue, you use the `enqueue` action. This is done with an `O(1)` operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (`n`); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

### Dequeue O(1)

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the `dequeue` action. This is done with an `O(1)` operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the `front` Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `dequeue`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

```
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

### Peek O(1)

When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `front` Node of the queue.

Typically, you want to check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

We do not re-assign the `next` property when we `peek` because we want to keep the reference to the next Node in the queue. This will allow the `front` to stay in the front until we decide to `dequeue`.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```

### IsEmpty O(1)

Here is the pseudocode for `isEmpty`:

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
