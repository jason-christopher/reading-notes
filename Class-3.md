# Class 3 Notes

## What is git? 
* Version control system that lets multiple users work on the same code
* Keeps track of changes and keeps all of your projects in one repository 

## Terms

* Commit - a "snapshot" of file
* HEAD - most up-to-date "commit"

## Other Notes
* Give messages to commits that act as captions for your snapshot

## What is GitHub?

* An online place to store code to share with others 
* If git is a sport, GitHub is the arena
* Manages work with version control, reviweing changes, and keeps changes separate until you want to add them
