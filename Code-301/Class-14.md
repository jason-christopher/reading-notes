# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
   * The share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
   * The idea that computers are for boys became a narrative.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
   * When they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
   * Diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes.  
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
   * When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
