# MongoDB and Mongoose

## SQL vs NoSQL

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL         | NoSQL       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Relational Databases| Npn-Relational Databases|
| Table-Based Databases| Document-Based Databases|
| Relational Databases| Non-Relational Databases|
| Pre-defined Schema| Dynamic Schema for Unstructured Data|
| Vertically Scalable| Horizontally Scalable|
| Good For Complex Queries| Not Good For Complex Queries|

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
   * Numeric data types.
2. Give a real world example.
   * Dates, inventory, etc.
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
   * Hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
4. Give a real world example.
   * Color: red;
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
   * NoSQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
   * SQL - vertically scalable
   * NoSQL - horizontally scalable

## More SQL vs NoSQL

1. What does SQL stand for?
   * Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?
   * We have a database which works with certain assumptions and supports the Structured Query Language.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
   * Tables
4. What is a ‘schema’?
   * The “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models.
5. What is a NoSQL database?
   * MongoDB
6. How does it work?
   * Has collections rather than relations that may have different structures and schemas.
7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
   * Collections and documents
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
   * MongoDB, because SQL is much more rigid with strict schemas, while MongoDB is very flexible.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
   * Relational data must be entered manually and may have duplicate data.
