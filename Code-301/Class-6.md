2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
   * Google's engine used in Chrome to run JavScript. It is asynchronous which means it can run multiple requests at a time and logs requests in an events-based log.
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
   * Unlike Chrome's V8 engine, it doesn't run in a browser and runs independently on a computer.
4. What is npm?
   * A package manager that comes bundled with Node.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
   * v18.11.0
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
   * 8.19.2
7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
   * `npm install -g jshint` (globally)
8. What is node used for?
   * Building scalable network applications.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
   * Engaged Collaboration - I can make a pretty good product on my own, but I know the benefits of diversity in preferences and creativity to make a more well-rounded product.
3. How does pair programming work?
   * Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
