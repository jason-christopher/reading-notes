# REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
   * He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
   * Machines don't have a universal way of talking to each other. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of communicating. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems communicate.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
   * HTTP?
4. What does a GET do?
   * The browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
5. What does a POST do?
   * If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.
6. What does PUT do?
   * If a system wants to replace something in another system, it use PUT.
7. What does PATCH do?
   * If a system wants to do a partial update, it will use PATCH.
