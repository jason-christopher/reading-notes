# Class 12 - Canvas and Chart.js

## JavaScript Canvas

1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to achieve?
   * To draw two-dimensional graphics using JavaScript.
2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?
   * Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the `<canvas>` element. <https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/>
3. Explain what the `getContext()` method does.
   * It returns a render context object. The type of context is the single argument. Use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface. The 2D rendering context allows you to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.
