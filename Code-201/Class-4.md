# Class 4 - HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
   * `<a>` anchor tag with the URL attached to the `href=""` attribute.
2. The `href` attribute contains what information?
   * The ***target*** which can be a file location or URL.
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
   * By adding a `title` attribute in the ***anchor*** tag with a clear title name in plain text.

## CSS Layout & Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
   * The way a page is structured and arranged without any modifications. 
2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?
   * `block` elements fill the entire available inline space, while an `inline-block` element only fills the amount of space required to fit the content. You can adjust the height and width for `block`, but not for `inline-block`.
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
   * Static
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
   * Absolutely positioned elements don't exist in the normal flow and are separate from other elements, which can create features that don't interfere with any other elements.
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
   * Absolute positioned elements stay in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, while fixed positioned elements are fixed to the specifics positions of the page.

## Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
   * Declaring a function creates a function, while invoking a function "calls" the function and executes the code.
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
   * Function parameters are the variables used when declaring and invoking a function (usually found within the parentheses of the function). Arguments are the actual values being passed to the function during execution.

## Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
   * Social Skills - Working with someone that may have a different personality or coding style can help develop my interpersonal skills and diversify my coding techniques to attempt techniques I may have never tried.
   * Job Interview Readiness - I need to practice my job interview skills, so Pair Programming will help to practice these skills and communication skills in general.
