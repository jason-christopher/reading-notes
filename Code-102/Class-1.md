# Class 1 - Learning Markdown

## Heading

* Headings can be identified using `#` through `######`
* `#` is the largest heading while `######` is the smallest
* There must be a space after the `#`, and leave a blank line before/after the heading text

## Text Decorations

* Add a `*` before/after text (without a space) to make it italic
* Add a `**` before/after text (without a space) to make it bold
* Add a `***` before/after text (without a space) to make it bold ***and*** italic. 

## Block Quotes

* Use a `>` to make a block quote

* I don't know how to resize it yet...

## Code

* Input code using backticks to make the text appear as `code`
* If the text you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the text in double backticks (``code``)

## Horizontal Rules

* Create a horizontal line by using `***` or `---` on its own line

## Links

* To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses
* `[Google](https://www.google.com)`
* [Google](https://www.google.com)
* To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets
* `<https://www.google.com>`
* <https://www.google.com>
