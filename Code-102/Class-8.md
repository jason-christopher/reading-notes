# Class 8 - Operators and Loops

***(Expressions & Operators can be found in the Class-7 notes)***

## Loops and Iteration

* Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 
* There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.
* The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop.

***

## `for` Statement

A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false` and looks like the following:

```
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
```

When a `for` loop executes, the following occurs:

1. The initializing expression `initialExpression`, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
2. The `conditionExpression` expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is `true`, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the `for` loop terminates. (If the `conditionExpression` expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be `true`.)
3. The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a ***block statement*** `({ })` to group those statements.
4. If present, the update expression `incrementExpression` is executed.
5. Control returns to Step 2.

```
function howMany(selectObject) {
  let numberSelected = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < selectObject.options.length; i++) {
    if (selectObject.options[i].selected) {
      numberSelected++;
    }
  }
  return numberSelected;
}

const btn = document.getElementById('btn');

btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const musicTypes = document.selectForm.musicTypes;
  console.log(`You have selected ${howMany(musicTypes)} option(s).`);
});
```

***

## `while` Statement

* A `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. A `while` statement looks as follows:

```
while (condition)
  statement
```

* If the condition becomes `false`, `statement` within the loop stops executing and control passes to the `statement` following the loop.
* The condition test occurs before `statement` in the loop is executed. If the condition returns `true`, `statement` is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns `false`, execution stops, and control is passed to the `statement` following `while`.
* To execute multiple `statements`, use a ***block statement*** `({ })` to group those statements.

```
let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}
```

### Example 1

With each iteration, the loop increments `n` and adds that value to `x`. Therefore, `x` and `n` take on the following values:

* After the first pass: `n = 1` and `x = 1`
* After the second pass: `n = 2` and `x = 3`
* After the third pass: `n = 3` and `x = 6`

After completing the third pass, the condition `n < 3` is no longer `true`, so the loop terminates.

### Example 2

Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes `false`â€”otherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the following `while` loop execute forever because the condition never becomes `false`:

```
// Infinite loops are bad!
while (true) {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```
