# Code 102 Reading Notes

### About Me 

My name is Jason Christopher and I live in Oklahoma City with my wife and 2 sons. We've been stationed in OKC since 2013 and will be here for the foreseeable future since my wife is on active duty orders with the Oklahoma Army National Guard. I was active duty Air Force for 8 years before deciding I've had enough and transitioned to the Air Force Reserves where I still do the same job of being an Air Battle Manager on the E-3 AWACS...but now only part-time and without the extra "stuff" from active duty! I also did the military contractor gig for about 2 years, but it wasn't fulfilling and now I want to start over in a new career field that will allow me to work from home or work anywhere across the country if we decide to move in the future. I debated between the Coding and Ops pathway with Code Fellows, but after the Code 101 course, I discovered I really enjoyed the software development side, although I still will pursue the cyber security path on my own time and plan on taking my CompTIA Security+ exam in the next few weeks.

1. I won't be an expert in one week!
2. I will fail, it's how I recover after failure.
